# Who I Am

Hello! My name is **Sebastian Aranda Sanchez**, I'm from **Chile** üá®üá±Ô∏è and I work as a **Fullstack Software Engineer** üë®‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è. I'm passionate about **Science**, **Technology**, **Astronomy**, **Artificial Intelligence** and **Education**. I studied **Computer Engineering** at the **Federico Santa Maria Technical University** (UTFSM, by its acronym in Spanish) in Chile, where I learned the fundamentals of **Mathematics**, **Physics**, and **Chemistry**, and took engineering courses in **Computing and Programming**, **Project Management**, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, and **Machine Learning (ML)**. At the UTFSM, I got closer to the world of computing and astronomy through the **Chilean Virtual Observatory** (ChiVO, by its acronym in Spanish) project. I've been working for about **8 years as a Software Engineer**, mostly as a **Fullstack Web Developer**, but I enjoy engaging in various areas of computer science and software development. I like working in multidisciplinary teams, learning from others, and creating solutions collaboratively ‚Äî that‚Äôs what motivates me. I'm highly structured, committed, and disciplined in my work, always focused on achieving objectives aligned with the mission of the organization I‚Äôm part of. I currently work as a **Fullstack Software Engineer at the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory](https://rubinobservatory.org/en) üî≠Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è**, where I collaborate with an amazing and diverse team of engineers, astronomers, and scientists, contributing a grain of sand to the discovery of our beautiful and vast universe. I invite you to visit my professional profile on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seba-aranda/) to learn more about what I‚Äôm doing.

I also dedicate part of my time to volunteering in social projects. Right now, I‚Äôm one of the coordinators of an educational project that belongs to a non-profit foundation: **[Escuelas Recrear](https://www.escuelasrecrear.cl/)**, where I contribute to supporting immigrant children in Santiago, Chile.

In the future, I‚Äôm interested in taking technical leadership roles, such as **Tech Lead** or **Software Architect**, to help define scalable solutions and guide development teams. You can check out my resume here: [CV](/cv__english_.pdf).

# My Skills

I am a fullstack software engineer with comprehensive experience in web development, DevOps, distributed systems, and technology integration projects. Throughout my career, I have been involved in complex projects ranging from user interface development and systems integration to working with sensors and external hardware, always with a pragmatic, collaborative, and solution-oriented approach. In addition, I have experience in technical project management, leading development teams, coordinating multidisciplinary efforts, and ensuring the delivery of solutions aligned with the strategic goals of each organization.

# Hobbies and Interests

I've always been curious about our place in the **Universe**, so I enjoy learning about **Astronomy**, **Nature** and **Sciences** in general. I love watching documentaries on science and technology, as well as reading books and articles on these topics.

As a mileniall and a digital native, I have a strong interest in **Technologies** and how they can be used to improve our lives. I‚Äôm particularly fascinated by the potential of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Science** to transform industries and create innovative solutions. I also have a passion for **Open Source Software** and believe in the power of community-driven development. Likewise I've recently become interested in **Blockchain** technology and its potential to revolutionize various sectors, including finance, supply chain, and digital identity.

In my free time I like playing **Video Games**, watching **Movies, Series and Documentaries**, and spending time with my family. I enjoy listening to **Hip Hop**, **Rap**, and **Electronic** music. I also love **Cycling** and **Hiking** in the nature. I also have a strong interest in **Education** particularly in its role as a tool for social change and empowerment. I believe in the value of sharing knowledge and helping others learn, and I actively seek opportunities to contribute to educational initiatives, whether through mentoring, volunteering, or participating in community-driven teaching projects.
