# My dream

To work in astronomy and computing: I consider myself a great programmer, but I would love to put my skills at the service of astronomy.

# Who am I

Hello, I am a computer engineer who loves science and astronomy. I've studied at Federico Santa Mar√≠a Technical University, where I've learned most of my academic knowledge. I like multidisciplinary work spaces, learn from others and generate solutions together is my motivation. I am very structured, commited and disciplined with my work. In my adolescence I've dedicated great part of my time be volunteer in social projects, this allows me to have another perspective regarding many social things. I'm currently the coordinator of a project in a non-profit educational fundation [Escuelas Recrear](https://www.escuelasrecrear.cl/) in which I actively participate and also work at [Inria Chile](https://inria.cl/es) where I perform as a software engineer, developing IT solutions. 

# My skills

Thanks to my time in Escuelas Recrear I have a lot of experience in project management, teamwork and communication.

# My interests

Small change.
