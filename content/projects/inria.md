# When

From Oct 2020 to Today

# Where

At [INRIA](https://www.inria.cl/) for collaboration with the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org/).

# What

I've worked as programmer and currently project leader of LOVE, the LSST Operators Visualization Environment, a system to monitor several components of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. This Observatory has over 65 subsystems that monitors different aspects of the telescope and its environment. LOVE is connected to the mayority of these systems.

I started working in LOVE when it had 1 year of development. At the beginning I performed as programmer having to understand the basis of a complex and beautiful system. After some time I changed my role to proyect leader, shortening my time programing but also giving full time to the needs of the project in its entire spectrum.

What I've done here:
- Management and planification of the project schedule.
- Support in UI/UX decisions.
- Define sprint objectives and lead a team of 4 persons.
- Develop ReactJS features and components.
- Work on deployment infrastructure: Docker & Kubernetes.
- Documentation for different components of the system.
- Adding testing for frontend and backend features.
- Support requirement verification and validation process.
- Design methods to ensure the system's performance.

I also had the opportunity to visit the Observatory, fulfilling one of my dreams. You can check me working on the right side of the following picture:
