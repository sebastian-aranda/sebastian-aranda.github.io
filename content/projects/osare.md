# Where

At OSARE

# What

I've participated on the creation an entrepreneurship company called OSARE, we focused on developing innovative apps. This was one of my first job approachs, so it was the beginning of my development carrer. We were able to develop two applicaitons:

* HelpyCar: an application used to geolocate car workshops in case you required any urgent service. This was developed in native Android and we never did a release, but it served as a first approach to the software development.
* Dubbin: an entertainment application used to create dubs of scenes of any video you uploaded to the app. I've participated on the firt release of the app which was developed using native Android. I didn't participate on the last release which got published on the Apps Stores.
