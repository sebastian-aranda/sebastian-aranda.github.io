      <description>Where At ENOVUS
What I&amp;rsquo;ve worked implementing a lot of LMS systems (Learning Management Systems) used for e-learning education. I&amp;rsquo;ve developed several components of different kind, in Frontend and Backend. Also worked with a lot of clients, using and agile approach with regular meetings to indentify, discuss and validate requirements.
How Frontend: HMTL, CSS, CSS3, SASS, Javascript

With better spectral resolution in data, a new challenge is set in the way astronomical data is analyzed. In particular, data cubes produced by radioastronomy projects have generated an explosion in the volume of data retrieved.</description>
