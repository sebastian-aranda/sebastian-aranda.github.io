      <description>When From Aug 2014 to Feb 2020
Where At ENOVUS
What I&amp;rsquo;ve worked implementing a lot of LMS systems (Learning Management Systems) used for e-learning education. I&amp;rsquo;ve developed several components of different kind, in Frontend and Backend. Also worked with a lot of clients, using and agile approach with regular meetings to indentify, discuss and validate requirements.
How Frontend: HMTL, CSS, CSS3, SASS, Javascript
Backend: AMP stack (Apache, Mysql -Maria DB- and PHP)</description>

Where At OSARE
What I&amp;rsquo;ve participated on the creation an entrepreneurship company called OSARE, we focused on developing innovative apps. This was one of my first job approachs, so it was the beginning of my development carrer. We were able to develop two applicaitons:
 HelpyCar: an application used to geolocate car workshops in case you required any urgent service. This was developed in native Android and we never did a release, but it served as a first approach to the software development.</description>

      <description>Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation model implementation for spectral line classification on ALMA Astronomy Datacubes
The discipline of astroinformatics has grown a lot over the past few years thanks to the creation of bigger and more sophisticated telescopes, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. With better spectral resolution in data, a new challenge is set in the way astronomical data is analyzed. In particular, data cubes produced by radioastronomy projects have generated an explosion in the volume of data retrieved.</description>
